##rule1

//return JSX
const App = () => ( <div>this is jsx</div> )

//return jsx with computation
const App = () => {
const a = 10
const b = 20
return ( A is {a} and b is {b} )

}


##rule2
every tag must be closed
in html
<br>
in jsx
<br />

##rule3
component names must be capitalized
<app> is not acceptable but <App> is perfectly fine

##rule4
The content of a react element must be enclosed with a root element. so we wrap them with a div with no attributes like
<div>
  <p> hello world</p>
 </div>
 
 Alternative is to pass an array of elements
 const App = () => {
  return [
    <h1>Greetings</h1>,
    <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />,
    <Footer />
  ]
}


better alternative is to use fragments enclosing with <></>
const App = () => {
  const name = 'Peter'
  const age = 10

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Greetings</h1>
      <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />
      <Hello name={name} age={age} />
      <Footer />
    </>
  )
}


##rule5
react try to adhere to functional programming's immutable architecture
so use concat to create new array instead of push
