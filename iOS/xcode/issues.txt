code preview not loading after Xcode 13.2 installation
says can't build content.view

Solution:

Run the following commands

sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
sudo xcodebuild -license

keep hitting spaces and type agree to enable license

didn't work? then try

rm -rf "$TMPDIR/../C/clang/ModuleCache"

didn't work? then try

Xcode - Preferences -> Locations and assigning the Command Line Tools to Xcode 13.2 or the current version.

clearning the clang cache worked for me
